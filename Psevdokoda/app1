When the document is ready, do the following:
    Initialize 'input' as "0" and 'calculationPerformed' as false.
    
    When any 'td' element is clicked, do the following:
        Get the inner HTML of the clicked element and assign it to 'vnos'.

        If 'vnos' is "C", do the following:

            If a calculation has been performed, reset 'input' to "0" and 'calculationPerformed' to false.
            If a calculation has not been performed, clear 'input'.
            Update the display with the new 'input'.

        Else if 'vnos' is "Del", do the following:

            Remove the last character from 'input'.
            Update the display with the new 'input'.

        Else if 'vnos' is "=", do the following:

            Try to calculate the result of the 'input' expression.
            If the calculation is successful, update the display with the result, convert the result to a string, and set 'calculationPerformed' to true.
            If an error occurs during the calculation, set 'input' to "Error", update the display, and clear 'input'.

        Else, do the following:

            If the current display is "0", "Error", or "NaN", set 'input' to the clicked value.
            Otherwise, append the clicked value to 'input'.
            Update the display with the new 'input'.
